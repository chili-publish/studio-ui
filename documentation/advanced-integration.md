# Studio UI Advanced integration

## Concepts

### UI options

The UI is configurable by some UI options explained in the concepts below.

#### Widgets

Studio UI is build with a couple of widgets, that are configurable. The list below contains all widgets available in the latest build. Widgets can be viewed as a component or a group of components working together.
Configurable widgets are able to be hidden, or in some cases you can add events to the widget, which will do something.
